# Ichthyolog
Ichthyolog is a cross-platform mobile app dedicated to the accurate documentation of aquatic flora and fauna in Singapore. 

# Features

It allows users to take pictures of aquatic species they come across and share or discuss them with other users on the platform in real-time. 
Each user sighting will be correctly identified and verified by experts on the platform, before being added to a database of all species sighted thus far.
The app also makes use of algorithms to perform smart analysis of all collated data to display trends and distribution for different species.

By bringing on board citizen scientists and expert researchers from the field, we aim to put together a scientifically accurate documentation of the diverse aquatic ecosystem in Singapore.
The data collected will be made openly available to aid in conservation and research efforts for Singapore's local aquatic ecosystem.
